Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority,
it is time to reform (or pause and reflect).
― Mark Twain

The fool doth think he is wise,
but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.
― William Shakespeare, As You Like It

By three methods we may learn wisdom:
First, by reflection, which is noblest;
Second, by imitation, which is easiest;
and third by experience, which is the bitterest.
― Confucious
